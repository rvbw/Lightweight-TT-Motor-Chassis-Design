# Lightweight TT Motor Chassis Design

## Overview
This project presents a **single-part chassis design** for TT motors.  
The design was created without performing any mechanical assembly and focuses on meeting strict weight and size constraints.

## Design Objectives
- Design a lightweight chassis suitable for TT motors.
- Ensure total weight does not exceed **13 grams**.
- Keep overall dimensions within **120 × 100 mm**.
- Validate the design using a slicer before fabrication.

## Design Scope
- Single-part mechanical design (no assembly).
- Designed for 3D printing.
- Weight and size verified using slicing software.

## Validation
- Weight checked using slicer software.
- Dimensions verified to stay within required limits.
- Design optimized for minimal material usage while maintaining structural integrity.
